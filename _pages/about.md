I am a researcher dedicated to engineering innovation, sustainability, and global impact. I am currently a member of Professor [David Clarke](https://clarke.seas.harvard.edu)'s lab at Harvard University, where I study high-temperature materials for more efficient engines.

During my doctoral research at Northeastern University, I worked in Professor [Yi Zheng](https://nanoenergy.sites.northeastern.edu)'s lab on materials and devices for sustainable water purification and cooling.

I am also the CEO of Boston-based startup company [Planck Energies](https://www.planckenergies.com), where we are working to make cheaper, greener passive radiative cooling technologies more accessible across the globe.

I'm always eager to meet new researchers and hear diverse perspectives from across the sciences - please feel free to [email](mailto:andrew.caratenuto@gmail.com) me with questions on my work, thoughts on future projects, or to discuss engineering and technology in general.
