    <h3>A Successful Thesis Defense!</h3>
    <p>
      Very proud to have successfully defended my thesis, "Thermal, Optical, and Materials Design for Water and Energy Sustainability." This milestone marks the culmination of years of energy and materials research at Northeastern. A big thank you to my advisor, thesis committee, labmates, collaborators, and friends and family for helping make this possible!
